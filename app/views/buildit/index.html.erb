		<h4>Yo should develop a TODO App that includes the following features</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>First of all, we need to create a rails application for that of course we need to have Rails install in our computer you will need to have at least v5.0 and ruby v2.2 then you can simply create a new Rails Project by running the following command: 'rails new project_name' then proceed to create the controller for the main view which in our case will be the 'rails g controller welcome index' if you notice we added an index view for this controller itÂ´s only optional if you use 'rails g controller welcome' and then create a view manually as you prefer.
				After this you can create your first model; for this you can use the following command 'rails g model List' and the create the controller as before</li>
