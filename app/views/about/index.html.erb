		<p>Developed in Ruby on Rails, the Web app allows the user to have TODOÂ´s lists and tasks with in those lists. The web app knows which Lists and Tasks belong to each user, thanks to the references created to the DataBase.
		For the Authentification used Devise gem, which basically did everything for me.
